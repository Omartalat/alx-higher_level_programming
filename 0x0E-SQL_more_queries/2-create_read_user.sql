-- Write a script that creates the database hbtn_0d_2 and the user user_0d_2.
-- 	user_0d_2 should have only SELECT privilege in the database hbtn_0d_2
-- 	The user_0d_2 password should be set to user_0d_2_pwd
-- 	If the database hbtn_0d_2 already exists, your script should not fail
-- 	If the user user_0d_2 already exists, your script should not fail

-- creates a database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hbtn_0d_2;
-- creates a user
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'user_0d_2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_0d_2_pwd';
-- grants SELECT privileges to a user
GRANT SELECT ON hbtn_0d_2.* TO 'user_0d_2'@'localhost';
